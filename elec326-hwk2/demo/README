A bunch of test Verilog programs: "foo1" through "foo4".

Each file has two modules: A module that implements some  combinational logic, and
an associated Testbench module ("tb"). The testbench exercises the combinational logic 
module with a suite of input vectors and records the response of the circuit.

The Verilog compiler is in "pjv" home directory on CLEAR.
The  file "alias.txt"  shows the complete pathname for the iverilog compiler:
     	   ~pjv/326/Verilog/bin/iverilog


You can compile using:
% ~pjv/326/Verilog/bin/iverilog foo1.v

Execute using:
% ./a.out

Observe the output and verify that it makes sense.


Alias
-----
To avoid having to remember and type in the long string to  access the iverilog compiler,
it is convenient to set up an alias for it.

You can type the line shown in the file "alias.txt" on the command line (just need to do it once).
Or more simply type the command:

% source ./alias.txt

You should then be able to invoke iverilog using the alias "iv".
To compile "foo1.v"  simply type:

% iv foo1.v

Some Unix Shortcuts:
----------------------
1. The "Up Arrow" key allows you to scrill through previous commands. Find a command you want and simply press enter instead of typing it again.
 
2. The "TAB" key can be used for automatic completion of commands and file names.

3. To repeat an earlier command you can use the exclamation mark (!) key.

|iv executes the last command beginning with "iv"
!n executes the last command beginning with "n", for instance your last invovation of "nan0" (editor)

BE CAREFUL: 
   You may do something terrible like Deleting all your files if you dont pay attention while using shortcuts!
   It remembers command across sessions, and while 
        rm *
   (which deletes all your files) may have made sense in some context, 
   repeating it in your main directory using
       !r
    can be  very unpleasant!
