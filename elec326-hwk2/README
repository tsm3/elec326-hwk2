There are three problems with associated files.

Problem 1: Unsigned Integer Comparator 
cmp.v:	   Template for "cmp" module you must complete
cmp_tb.v   Testbench module to exercise and verify your solution

After entring your program in "cmp.v" compile using iVerilog.

% iv cmp.v cmp_tb.v

Edit and correct errors as necessary. Then execute as:

% ./a.out

Check the outputs are correct.
-----------------------------------------------------------

Problem 2: Multiply a BCD integer in the range 0 .. 499 by 2
doubleBCD.v:	   Template for "doybleBCD" module you must complete
doubleBCD_tb.v     Testbench module to exercise and verify your solution

After entring your program in "doubleBCD.v" compile using iVerilog.

% iv doubleBCD.v doubleBCD_tb.v

Edit and correct errors as necessary. Then execute as:

% ./a.out

Check the outputs are correct.

-----------------------------------------------------------

Problem 3: Convert an unsigned  binary integer in the range 0..255 to its 3 digit BCD representation
doubleBCD.v:	   Use your working solution from Problem 2
bin2BCD.v          Template for "bin2BCD" module you must complete
bin2BCD_tb.v 	   Testbench module to exercise and verify your solution

After entring your program in "bin2BCD.v" compile using iVerilog. Since your solution will use the module "doubleBCD"
from Problem 2, include the "doubleBCD.v" file while compiling as below. 

% iv bin2BCD.v doubleBCD.v bin2BCD_tb.v

Edit and correct errors as necessary. Then execute as:

% ./a.out

Check the outputs are correct.



 Unix HINTS:
-------------
To see the output a screenfull at a time:

%  ./a.out | more 

(b)  To redirect  the output in a file called "out" to be displayed later.

%  ./a.out > out

(c) To display "out" use:

%  more out

Use spacebar to scroll to next screenfull
