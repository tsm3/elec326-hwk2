You  should have three subdirectories "decoder", "alu", and "branch".
Develop the modules in that order. You can check each module as shown below.


To test module "decoder":
-----------------
Connect to the "decoder" subdirectory

% iv decoder.v tb_decoder.v -o decoderx
% ./decoderx > out

Output will be redirected to file "out"

You can examine the file using "more" or "less" commands.
Compare against the expected results using the "diff" command.

% diff out results_decoder
No output is good news.  All tested cases match!!


To test module "alu":
----------------------
Connect to the "alu" subdirectory
Copy your working "decoder.v" file to the "alu" subdirectory.

% iv decoder.v regfile.v alu.v  tb_alu.v -o alux
% ./alux > out
% diff out results_alu

To test module "branch":
------------------------
Connect to te "branch" subdirectory
Copy your working "decoder.v" and "alu.v" files to the "branch" subdirectory.

% iv decoder.v regfile.v alu.v branch.v tb_branch.v -o branchx 
% ./branchx > out
% diff out results_branch
